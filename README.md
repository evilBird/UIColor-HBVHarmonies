UIColor-HBVHarmonies
====================

Blocks-based UIColor category that makes creating color harmonies easy.

Usage: Import "UIColor+HBVHamonies.h" and use as with UIColor.

What: This is a class category I've reused quite a bit to create interesting color schemes with minimal effort. It includes convenience methods for creating random colors, color complements, and jittering colors. For more fine-grained control use the  colorHarmonyWithExpression: or colorHarmonyWithExpressionOnComponents: instance methods. These methods take a block that operates on individual R-G-B-A values.

Wait, what?: Check out the demo project, it should get you going.
